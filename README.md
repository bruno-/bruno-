# Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bruno Sutic and I'm a senior full-stack developer working with web
technologies for over a decade. I work primarily with Ruby, Ruby on Rails,
vanilla JavaScript, and Ansible.

I specialize in working with Async Ruby. [Get in touch](mailto:github.contact@brunosutic.com)
if you need Async Ruby training or help with a project.

I'm a founder at [linkok.com](https://linkok.com).

I created:

- [Tmux plugins](https://github.com/tmux-plugins)
- [Capistrano plugins](https://github.com/capistrano-plugins)
- [Vim utilities](https://github.com/vim-utils)
